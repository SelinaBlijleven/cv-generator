## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile.jpg">

Machine Learning Engineer, Software Engineer, Technical Writer, Data Scientist,  
and all-round technology geek. Currently employed at CodeCafé, where I get to 
combine a passion for a wide range of technology with my passion for teaching and learning. 
As a teacher, I aim to give students and professionals a place to express and explore 
topics in a supportive environment.

Education on the topic of Trustworthy AI and ethics questions 
surrounding AI are very important to me and always a good topic for an open 
discussion. I like applying a little bit of humor and creativity to everything I do, 
especially when it comes to my hobbies.
